## Purpose 
Push the boundaries of what it means to be a slack clone. Also demonstrate some play+scala goodies.

## Background
This is a small introductory course on scala+play. 
It attempts to be fairly blue-collar by showing how to implement everyday functionality without delving too deep into the nitty gritty of FP or other big ideas. Instructors are, of course, free to delve as deep as they like.

## How it works
This repo contains a pretty neat play application that compiles fine, but has some blanks that need to be filled in. 
Students will be filling in the blanks.

A list of tasks can be found in the `tasks.md` file under the `goodies` directory. 
The idea is that an instructor will guide the students task by task, demoing and explaining as they go along.

If you are an instructor, I would suggest preparing by going through and completing the tasks yourself, making sure you know how to do and explain everything.

If you are a student that wishes to attempt this by yourself, you can find the solutions for the tasks in the `lesson-x` branches of this repo. 
Each task should have a corresponding commit (more or less).

## Lessons

Right now, there is only one lesson. The solution for that lesson can be found on the `lesson-1` branch.
If this lesson is presented by an instructor, and every student's DB, IDE and other dependencies are set up, this lesson can take 3-4 hours to complete.
Since the lesson consists of smaller tasks, instructors are free to split it up into smaller chunks.

Only basic programming skills are assumed in students, but instructors should preferably have some experience with the subject matter.

More lessons should be added soon.
